Today I added some symbols like LEDs, Buttons, Resistors, the Arduino, and Buzzer to my schematic. I created net labels and started the wiring. I also brainstormed on the rest of my features and came up with a plan.

Time Worked: 31mins

After my brainstorming and a loong break, I added all my final components to my schematic and wired those too. I thought of the PCB Layout too and came up with an idea.

Time Worked: 1hr 17mins

Today I FINALLY finished my whole PCB with routing and everything. I also added some HC Art. and a JST Connector for a bat, there's also a DC Barrel Jack if someone wants to connect a 9V Battery or power supply - idk who would connect a power supply to a portable device lol, but I still have an LDO just in case.

Time Worked: 1hr 19mins
