Today I added some symbols like LEDs, Buttons, Resistors, the Arduino, and Buzzer to my schematic. I created net labels and started the wiring. I also brainstormed on the rest of my features and came up with a plan.

Time Worked: 31mins

After my brainstorming and a loong break, I added all my final components to my schematic and wired those too. I thought of the PCB Layout too and came up with an idea.

Today I FINALLY finished my whole PCB with routing and everything. I also added some HC Art. and a JST Connector for a bat, there's also a DC Barrel Jack if someone wants to connect a 9V Battery or power supply - idk who would connect a power supply to a portable device lol, but I still have an LDO just in case.

Time Worked: 1hr 19mins

**Total worked to finish project designing: 2hrs 30mins and 21secs**

## June 18th: Ordering the PCB and Parts
Hi! Today I ordered my PCB and Parts, well not actually today, I ordered my components yesterday and my PCB a few days ago. The components got too expensive due to MOQ and Multiples but I had a $50 LCSC Coupon thanks to OSHWLab Stars, but it wasn't activating for some reason so I had to add any 1 extra part in my cart for it to work. So idk why but I added some FPC connectors or smthn, its MOQ was 5 so yay I'm getting 5 connectors that I don't even know what to do with. So uhhh I can't post any screenshots for the order bc that'll leak my address lol.
